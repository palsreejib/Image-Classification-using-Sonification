# Model Pipeline Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks implementing and training various CNN model pipelines for the **Image Sonification** project.

## Contents

Each notebook corresponds to a specific model architecture used to classify audio spectrograms generated from image sonification. These notebooks include:

- Model definition
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Training loop
- Evaluation metrics

## Notes

- The notebooks do **not** contain dataset files or outputs.
- For dataset information, refer to the `data/` directory or the main project README.

## How to Run

Make sure you've set up the correct environment as described in the [main README](../README.md), then open any notebook using Jupyter or VS Code to run the training pipeline.
